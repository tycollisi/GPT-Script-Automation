open() = Built-in function that opens a file and returns it, for example:

"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist.

Create environment variable in same terminal session before executing script:
1. Run the following command in the terminal:
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=put_api_key_here
2. import os 
3. Add the following variable to your code:
   api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
Be sure your API key is not visible anywhere else in your code and tadaa! Your API key is no longer hard-coded.
